# tsa
This is for a sql project working with tsa data. The point is to use sql to explore tsa check-in data and learn about how many people typically check-in during February and especially during the week of February 10th through 16th. I hope to use this information to begin looking at how to predict future behavior (i.e. how many people should we expect to fly next week?) 

Data is taken straight from the tsa website (https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes) and then copied into a csv. I used PostgreSQL for the sql portion.
